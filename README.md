# Work-Day-Scheduler

# Description

This webpage is a simple Work Day Scheduler application that I created using jQuery. One of the main reasons why I created this application was to practice dynamically updating HTML and CSS properties using jQuery to power it. Another reason was to see what I could do with libraries such as Moment.js and local storage.
